As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you.</td>\n",

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

Docket number (DOT-OST-2018-0068) and the Regulatory ID number (RIN No. 2105-AE63)I am very much in favor of amended regulations that provide strict definitions for what type of animals might be permitted to accompany flyers in the cabin of commercial aircraft. As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you. \n",

RE:  DOCKET NUMBER DOT-OST-2018-0068I am a psychotherapist who has worked with many people with PTSD and Severe panic attacks.  I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.\n",
              "4  DOT-OST-2018-0068-14920  ...  I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society. \n",

As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease.

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.</td>\n",

I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.

I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

The recommended, safer approach, for the purposes of this assignment:\n",

Community districts with higher proportion of poverty tend to have a greater number of low income housing, commmonly in substandard, not properly/adequately maintained conditions. Neglected maintenance of these housing units exposes residents to malfunctioning heating units and poor and unsanitary living conditions (mold, rodents, etc.,). As a result, I hypothesize that the greater the prevalence of poverty in a community district, the higher the likelihood that residents will inititate 311 requests about heat/hot water and unsanitary conditions"
